# Advanced_Language_Program_C
This repository contains all the coding exercises and examples from my second-semester C programming course, conducted under the guidance of Professor Wang Yunyun. The work closely follows the textbook The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

It provides a structured collection of programs covering:

Fundamental C syntax and programming concepts

Functions, arrays, and pointers

File handling and memory management

Implementation of standard algorithms and data structures

This repository serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others looking to learn or practice C programming in an academic context.
